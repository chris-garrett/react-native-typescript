# react-native-typescript

Just messing around or creating samples for bug reports. 

## Learnings

> RNN has a separate react component tree per screen (so also separate react context) 

Manage state outside of react. There are quite a few libraries out there that add 
on top of useState like: zustand, jotai, valtio, pipestate

## Questions

**Why do I get a full screen flicker when calling `navigation.navigate('Home')` or `navigation.pushToTop()`?**

I tried a few of the work arounds and none of them work.
